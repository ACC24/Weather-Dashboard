# Weather-Dashboard
This application was build to display current weather conditions, UV index, and 5-day forecast by city name.
Open Weather api was used to gather the data that populated the screen.
Every time the user types-in a city name, upon clicking the search button, weather data is displayed and a new button with the city name is created.
Each button labeled with the city typed-in by the user, has the the ability to recall the current weather conditions and 5-day forecast first displayed on the screen at the time of the user's first input.
